1. Whether the picture has been tampered with / Description of the tampered area: The picture has been tampered with. The tampered area is located in the upper half of the image, encompassing the entire background including the sky and the mountainous landscape.

2. Judgment basis: The tampering is evident due to several factors:
- Lighting: The lighting on the snowboarder and the background do not match. The snowboarder is lit from the front, casting a shadow to the back, while the background appears to be lit from the right, with no corresponding shadows.
- Edges: The edges of the mountains against the sky are unnaturally smooth and lack the detail expected in a typical landscape photograph.
- Perspective relationship: The perspective of the mountains does not align with the perspective of the snowboarder. The mountains appear to be a flat backdrop rather than a three-dimensional space that the snowboarder is in.
- Shadows: There are no shadows cast by the mountains onto the snow, which is inconsistent with the lighting on the snowboarder.
- Physical laws: The lack of interaction between the snowboarder and the environment, such as the absence of tracks in the snow leading up to the snowboarder or shadows cast by the mountains, suggests that the snowboarder was placed into the scene without consideration for the physical laws of light and shadow.
