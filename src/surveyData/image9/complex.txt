1. Whether the picture has been tampered with / Description of the tampered area: The picture has been tampered with. The tampering is located in the central area of the image, covering the majority of the stop sign and extending slightly into the surrounding space. The content of the tampered area includes the word "HARPER" written in red, which appears to be superimposed over the original stop sign.

2. Judgment basis: The basis for this judgment includes the following observations:
- The text "HARPER" has a different resolution and sharpness compared to the rest of the image, indicating it may have been digitally added.
- The edges around the letters of "HARPER" are not consistent with the natural edges found elsewhere in the image, suggesting a digital alteration.
- The lighting on the letters does not match the lighting on the stop sign, as there are no corresponding shadows or highlights that would be expected if the text were physically present.
- The perspective of the letters seems slightly off compared to the stop sign, which could indicate that the text was superimposed onto the image.
- The semantic information does not match reality, as the presence of the word "HARPER" over a stop sign is unusual and does not conform to typical traffic signage, which would not include such a message.
