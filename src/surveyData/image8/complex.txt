1. Whether the picture has been tampered with / Description of the tampered area: The picture has been tampered with. The tampered area is located in the central portion of the image, extending slightly to the right side. It encompasses a zebra that is standing in the water with its reflection visible in the water.

2. Judgment basis: The tampering is evident due to several factors:
- Lighting: The lighting on the zebra does not match the rest of the scene. The zebra appears to be under a different light source, as its shadows and highlights do not align with the lighting conditions observed on the other animals and the environment.
- Edges: The edges around the zebra are unnaturally sharp and exhibit a slight halo effect, which is indicative of a cut-and-paste editing technique.
- Resolution: The zebra's texture and resolution seem inconsistent with the surrounding environment, suggesting that it may have been inserted from another image.
- Perspective relationship: The zebra's size and positioning within the environment do not fully conform to the perspective of the scene, making it appear slightly out of place.
- Shadows: The zebra's reflection in the water is not consistent with the reflections of other objects in the scene, which suggests that the zebra's image may have been manipulated or inserted.
- Physical laws: The reflection of the zebra does not adhere to the physical laws of reflection, as it does not accurately represent the shape and position of the zebra above the water.
