1. Whether the picture has been tampered with / Description of the tampered area: The picture has been tampered with, specifically in the lower central portion of the image, where there is a swimming pool-like structure on the ground.

2. Judgment basis: The tampering is evident due to several factors:
- Lighting: The lighting on the pool structure does not match the rest of the scene. The overall scene is evenly lit, yet the pool area appears to have a different light source.
- Edges: The edges of the pool structure are unnaturally smooth and lack the detail present in the rest of the image, suggesting it has been digitally inserted.
- Perspective relationship: The pool structure seems out of place and does not follow the perspective of the rest of the image. It appears flat and does not conform to the angle and position it would naturally occupy in the scene.
- Shadows: There are no corresponding shadows for the pool structure that match the lighting of the scene, which is inconsistent with how shadows are cast in the rest of the image.
- Physical laws: The presence of a swimming pool in the middle of a field, as depicted, defies logical placement and does not align with the physical reality of the setting.
