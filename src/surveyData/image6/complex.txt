1. Whether the picture has been tampered with / Description of the tampered area: The picture has been tampered with. The tampered area is located at the bottom half of the image, extending from the lower left corner to the lower right corner, covering the entire width of the image. The content in the tampered area includes the ground and some rocks or boulders.

2. Judgment basis: The tampering is evident due to several factors:
- Lighting: The lighting on the tampered area does not match the rest of the image. The shadows and highlights on the rocks or boulders do not align with the lighting on the elephants and the surrounding environment.
- Edges: The edges of the rocks or boulders appear unnaturally sharp and defined against the background, suggesting that they may have been inserted into the image.
- Resolution: There is a noticeable difference in resolution between the tampered area and the rest of the image. The rocks or boulders appear to be of a lower resolution, with less detail compared to the rest of the scene.
- Perspective relationship: The perspective of the rocks or boulders does not seem to match the perspective of the elephants and the environment. The size and placement of the rocks or boulders appear unnatural.
- Shadows: The shadows cast by the rocks or boulders do not correspond with the direction and quality of the shadows seen elsewhere in the image, indicating that they may have been artificially added or manipulated.
- Physical laws: The arrangement and positioning of the rocks or boulders seem inconsistent with the natural lay of the land, suggesting that they have been artificially placed into the scene.
