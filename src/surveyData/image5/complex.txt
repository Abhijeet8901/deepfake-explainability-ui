1. Whether the picture has been tampered with / Description of the tampered area: The picture has been tampered with. The tampered area is located on the screen of the mobile device, occupying the central portion of the image. The content within this tampered area shows a scene with two cows and a soccer ball, which appears to be a field with a hill in the background.

2. Judgment basis: The tampering is evident due to several factors:
- Lighting: The lighting on the cows and the soccer ball does not match the lighting on the rest of the image, particularly the hand holding the device.
- Perspective relationship: The perspective of the cows and the soccer ball seems inconsistent with the perspective of the mobile device's screen.
- Shadows: There are no corresponding shadows on the screen that would be expected if the image on the screen was a real scene captured by a camera.
- Physical laws: The content displayed on the screen does not align with the physical laws that govern how images are displayed on a screen, such as the correct orientation and scale of the image relative to the device.
